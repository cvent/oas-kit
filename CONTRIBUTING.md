First of all, many thanks for considering making a contribution to this project.

# Submitting PRs
Please do not include any changes to `package-lock.json` in your PRs, even if you are updating package.json. These changes are almost impossible to review for security implications. If necessary, `package-lock.json` will be regenerated and committed by a maintainer after your PR is merged.

Please run the tests before submitting your pull request.
